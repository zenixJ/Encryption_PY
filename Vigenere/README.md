#### This method is a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. The Vigenere cipher has been invented many times. This method was first described by Giovan Battista Bellaso (Italian Giovan Battista Bellaso) in the book La cifra del. Sig. Giovan Battista Bellaso in 1553, but in the 19th century he received the name of Blaise Vigenere, a French diplomat. The method is simple to understand and implement, but is inaccessible to simple cryptanalysis methods.

#### Although the cipher is easy to understand and implement, for three centuries it has withstood all attempts to break it; which earned the name le chiffre ind√©chiffrable (fr. unsolved cipher). Many people have tried to implement encryption schemes that are essentially Vigenere ciphers.
