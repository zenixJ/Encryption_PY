# RSA cipher

#### is a public-key cryptographic algorithm based on the computational complexity of the large integer factorization problem.

<br />

#### The RSA cryptosystem was the first system capable of both encryption and digital signature. The algorithm is used in a wide range of cryptographic applications, including PGP, S/MIME, TLS/SSL, IPSEC/IKE, and others.
